###   about complexity 
The first set of code snippets is searching for two-digit and four-digit numbers that satisfy a
specific condition, while the second set of code snippets is searching for two-digit and four-digit
numbers that satisfy a different condition.

In terms of time complexity, both sets of code snippets have linear time complexity O(n) because
they loop through a range of n values. However, the constant factor for the second set of code
snippets may be slightly smaller because they only loop through a smaller range of values.

In terms of space complexity, both sets of code snippets have constant space complexity O(1)
because they use a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size.
